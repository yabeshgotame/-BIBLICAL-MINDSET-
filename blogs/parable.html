      <!-- Introduction -->
      <h2>Introduction to the Parables</h2>
      <p>
        Jesus often used parables—simple stories with profound spiritual lessons—to teach about the Kingdom of God. These parables are timeless and continue to inspire and challenge us today. Let’s explore some of the most well-known parables and their meanings.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Parable of the Sower -->
      <h2>The Parable of the Sower</h2>
      <img src="../images/parable-sower.png" alt="Parable of the Sower" class="blog-image">
      <p>
        Found in <strong>Matthew 13:1-23</strong>, the Parable of the Sower illustrates how different people respond to the Word of God. The seeds represent the Word, and the soils represent the hearts of people:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pathway:</strong> The seeds are eaten by birds, symbolizing those who hear the Word but do not understand it.</li>
        <li><strong>Rocky Ground:</strong> The seeds sprout quickly but wither due to lack of roots, representing those who receive the Word with joy but fall away in times of trouble.</li>
        <li><strong>Thorny Ground:</strong> The seeds are choked by thorns, symbolizing those who let worldly worries and wealth distract them from the Word.</li>
        <li><strong>Good Soil:</strong> The seeds produce a bountiful harvest, representing those who hear, understand, and live out the Word.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <!-- Parable of the Prodigal Son -->
      <h2>The Parable of the Prodigal Son</h2>

      <p>
        Found in <strong>Luke 15:11-32</strong>, the Parable of the Prodigal Son teaches us about God’s unconditional love and forgiveness. It tells the story of a young man who squanders his inheritance but is welcomed back by his father with open arms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Younger Son:</strong> Represents those who stray from God but return in repentance.</li>
        <li><strong>The Father:</strong> Symbolizes God’s boundless love and forgiveness.</li>
        <li><strong>The Older Son:</strong> Represents those who struggle with jealousy and self-righteousness.</li>

      <p>
        Found in <strong>Luke 10:25-37</strong>, the Parable of the Good Samaritan teaches us about loving our neighbors. It tells the story of a man who is robbed and left for dead, and how a Samaritan shows him compassion.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Robbers:</strong> Represent those who harm others for personal gain.</li>
        <li><strong>The Priest and Levite:</strong> Represent those who ignore the needs of others.</li>
        <li><strong>The Samaritan:</strong> Represents those who show love and compassion to others, regardless of differences.</li>
