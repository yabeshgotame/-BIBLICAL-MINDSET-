  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <section class="blog-section">
    <p class="lead-paragraph">In today's hyper-connected world, anxiety has become a silent epidemic. Social media, global crises, financial struggles, and personal expectations weigh heavily on our minds. The constant flood of information and comparison often leads to fear, worry, and self-doubt. However, as believers, we are called to walk by faith, not by sight (2 Corinthians 5:7).</p>
    
    <p>How do we silence the noise of anxiety and embrace God's peace in a world that never stops? The Bible offers a timeless antidote to fearâ€”God's presence, His promises, and practical wisdom for daily living. Let's explore how we can navigate anxiety in today's world with faith over fear.</p>

    <h2><span class="section-number">1.</span> Understanding the Root of Anxiety</h2>
    <img src="../images/overcoming_anxiety_faith.png" alt="Person praying with light breaking through darkness" class="blog-image">
    
    <p>Anxiety is often fueled by uncertainty and the desire for control. We worry about:</p>
    <ul class="featured-list">
      <li>The future</li>
      <li>Relationships</li>
      <li>Finances</li>
      <li>Health</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We wonder if we will have enough, if we will be enough, or if things will turn out as we hope.</p>
    
    <h3 class="scripture-heading">Biblical Perspective: Trusting God in the Unknown</h3>
    <p>The Bible consistently reminds us that we are not in control, but God is. Anxiety grows when we try to handle life's burdens alone, but faith thrives when we surrender to God's plan.</p>
    
    <blockquote class="bible-verse">
      <p>"Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?"</p>
      <cite>Matthew 6:25-27 (NIV)</cite>
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>God's provision is constant. When we fix our eyes on Him, we shift from fear of the unknown to faith in His promises.</p>
